# randomlygrownnetworks

My name is Ram√≥n Nartallo-Kaluarachchi.

This repository houses a project for the MA4J5 Structures of Complex Systems module at the Univeristy of Warwick Mathematics Institute. 

This project has two parts: the .pdf report and the .ipynb notebook. They should be read together. The report focuses on some more robust theory and discussions about the models and their neuroscientific inspiration, whereas the notebook allows you to play with the simulations and change parameters etc.

All helpers files are needed in order to run the code. The notebook should be run in order.

All code is written by me with the exception of the 'mynetworkx.py' file. This is an extensions to the NetworkX Python package that allows for multiple weights on a directed graph. It written by stackOverflow user kcoskun. I thank them for their contribution.  

I would also like to acknowledge the lecturer Dr Markus Kirkilionis for running the module as well as F. Ajazi, G. M. Napolitano, T. Turova, and I. Zaurbek, whose model formed the basis for this project.
